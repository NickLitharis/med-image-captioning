"Fig. 1 to illustrate normal division and to serve as a comparison for the experimental cells shown in following plates. The progress of experimental and control cells through mitosis was determined by observing nuclear events such as nuclear envelope breakdown, the start of the normal anaphase separation of half spindles (Fig. 1 d) and nuclear envelope reformation. These all provide relatively precise temporal markers. For experimental cells we also used the distribution and quantity of spindle birefringence to monitor their progress into telophase. This is important because spindles of altered geometry do not show a traditional anaphase movement of chromosomes; chromosomes pop apart but the chromatids do not move to opposite poles (14). In normal cells, the birefringence of the central spindle and asters gradually increases after nuclear envelope breakdown and reaches its highest value at or shortly after anaphase onset (Fig. 1, a-c). In early telophase ( ~ 5 min after anaphase onset) the halfspindle birefringence fades rapidly and the asters assume a larger, more diffuse, fibrous appearance (Fig. 1, d and e).",8636be9301565311d21cf3cf35c512c105ac937a_2-Figure1-1.png
